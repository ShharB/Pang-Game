Optional extra that was use:
-Three or more distinct consecutive levels, with increasing difficulty: 
The reason i add this is that in my opinion a game should have more one level of difficulty or different stages
to make the player engage in the game and give him more reasons to play the game.

-Custom soundtracks and SFX: 
The reason i add this is because soundtracks and SFX are one the main features to make the more player engage
in the game and without it the game feels empty.
